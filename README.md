## DVC
let's say that you have 100 GBS of data, you can't go ahead and store it in some repository, it will also be very much difficult for Git to manage that with respect to versioning.
so whenever you have this kind of huge it is always better to use DVC along with git to manage that data

## tutorial

 1. **initialize DVC**
`dvc init`
